Starting to use [BEM](https://en.bem.info/method/definitions/) for CSS in 2013/14 gave us a distinct boost to quality and performance.

It’s not that we didn’t know how to write modular CSS before. But BEM is like burning down your venue, leaving only __low level CSS specificity__.

And once you’ve figured out there’s some (element type based) __pseudo scope__ with BEM, you’re about to write even more modular CSS.

As long as CSS does not provide scope, I think BEM is the best workaround we have.
