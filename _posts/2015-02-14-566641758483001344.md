__[Hawaii Kona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kona_coffee)__ is pretty special. Turns out to be the worst coffee we had for month.

<small>Update:</small>  
Btw, while talking about coffee: if you had a chance to try indian [monsooned Malabar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsooned_Malabar) â€” don't miss it. Holy!
