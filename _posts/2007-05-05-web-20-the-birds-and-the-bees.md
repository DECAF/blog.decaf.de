![Web 2.0](/content/images/2015/02/web20.png)

As already mentioned [elsewhere](http://aktuell.de.selfhtml.org/weblog/web-20-bienen-und-bluemchen): the drawing emerged from thoughts about which basic conditions have to be fulfilled for working websites. Seems to be something like that: provider with purpose and sense meets user with attention and interest, and they both share benefit and added value.

Nothing to write home about, I just wanted to drop into conversation.  
_»And the drawing is still beta.«_
