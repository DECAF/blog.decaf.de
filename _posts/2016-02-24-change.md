This is about changing:

1. Carry your laptop bag on __one shoulder__ all the time? Use the other one and your body will thank you.
2. Stop drinking too much coffee. Try __tea__.
3. Change the __routes__ you’re driving or walking.
4. Start __thinking__ about things you didn’t think of before.
5. __Talk__ to people you didn’t talk to before.
6. Listen to __TED talks__ about changing or watch [Carpool Karaoke](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ1f3amS4y1ffYEhGZDtawaEyRQQu69Bw) instead.
7. __Travel__.
8. Make a __baby__?

Do it!

### Do not:

1. Develop another __JavaScript framework__.
2. Develop another __CSS framework__.
3. Develop another __PHP CMS__.

Don’t.
