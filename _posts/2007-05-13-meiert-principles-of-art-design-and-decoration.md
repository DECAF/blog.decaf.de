I just came across **Jens Meiert**‘s article about »[principles of art, design, and decoration](http://meiert.com/en/blog/20070512/principles-of-art-design-and-decoration/)«. And, hum, as I dwell upon communication design (beside coffee and stuff) while pretty often being confronted with websites to be *dolled up* for barbie contest, I’d love to refer to Meiert’s statement

> Art *hides*. [..]  
>  Design *reveals*. [..]  
>  Anything else that *doesn’t have meaning* is just decoration, at most.

Thank you for reducing to the max, Jens. According to your thoughts it’s been a while since I [dropped](http://community.de.selfhtml.org/my/zitatesammlung/zitat144) this one:

> Design is not the website’s flowery wallpaper but the character of its content.

From now on, I’ll go for the _»design reveals«_ thing.
