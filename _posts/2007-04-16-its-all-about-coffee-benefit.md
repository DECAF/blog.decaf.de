After we’d started with DECAF° in 2004 we thought of getting some place for coffee breaks and the web stuff that was coming along with projects. For a while, it wasn’t *that* much content (asuming to fill a weblog) and we haven’t had *that* much »time« to write it down.. but from now on we’d love to talk about flexible multi-column forms, fluid layouts, gentle px, serious blog navigation, developing wordpress plugins, using Redaxo CMS, achieving social software, the mobile web, the web 2.0 senior edition, bad caffeine and more.

This one is blogging for interest, used to be our humble opinion and is starting right now. Think we’ll have cookies for the <del>tea</del> coffee.
