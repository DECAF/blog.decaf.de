The colours of this posh thing on the left will clash with the ROW (Rest of this website). Sorry for that, but it’s a meaningful issue and we’ll have to be serious about it.

Quiet is the new Loud, but **POSH** is no more than the same old everyday job with now having a name for it. It’s about writing **plain old semantic HTML** instead of semantic html. It is `<p></p>` instead of `<font></font>`. And it is not beta but phi, chi or psi. It’s the web’s *All you need is love*, its *Street Fighting Man* or its *Bitter Sweet Symphony*. It is bigger than [Walt Whitman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman) and smarter than [Joanne K. Rowling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling). It’s as strong as [Colt Seavers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_Guy). A [White Russian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Russian_(cocktail)) without old-fashioned glasses. It is perfectly well-balanced, you can read it without having to look at it. And it doesn’t smell. It sounds like [Barry White](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_white) and we got it together, baby.  
All that is why we love it so much.

And by the way: [they say](http://www.mindgarden.de/index.php?id=703) that the german acronym for spicy websites may used to be »**fesch**«, which is *feines, einfaches, semantisch codiertes HTML*. It sounds similar to »Flash« but we like it anyway.
