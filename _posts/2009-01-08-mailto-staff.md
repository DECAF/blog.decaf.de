Multi-author/team blogs: The **WordPress plugin [mailto:staff](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mailtostaff/)** generates mailto links on the dashboard referring to all user groups of the blog. Quite handy way of internal staff communication if you don’t want to set up a mailing list or a server-side messaging system.

**Features:**

- Mailto links can address any of group admins, editors, authors, contributors and subscribers based on current user’s role.
- User roles: Subscribers can address admins only. Contributors can address editors and admins. Authors can address authors, editors and admins. Editors and admins can address all users.
- Duplicate email addys are removed.
- BCC mail if recipients contain subscribers (-> privacy!).
- Multi-language.
