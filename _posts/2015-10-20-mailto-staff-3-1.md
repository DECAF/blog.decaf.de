We released a new version of our WordPress plugin called [mailto:staff](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/mailtostaff/). You may go and grab it if you maintain a blog with several authors and want to write them emails.

Btw: [the project will no longer be maintained](https://github.com/DECAF/wordpress_mailtostaff). üêº
If you'd like to take it over and continue development, feel free to [contact us](https://twitter.com/_DECAF)!
