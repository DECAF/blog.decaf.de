__The article describes how to create a simple but beautiful world map which is powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) that allows for your users to add and manage their entries themselves.__

First of all: why that map? Because it‚Äôs great to see your community, to have it visualized on a map. It is also a chance to pay attention to everyone involved in the community. Share your location and your motivation to participate in the project and let everyone get an equal marker! ‚ô•

It‚Äôs pretty easy, this is what you need:

## 1. A GitHub repo with Pages enabled

The repo will contain your map website later on. It‚Äôs a static website which is generated and hosted by GitHub. They call it [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/), and it‚Äôs a pretty cool feature!

Set up your empty repository and __enable GitHub Pages__ in the repo settings. When enabled it should look like this:

You‚Äôll find detailed instructions at [GitHub Pages Basics](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/).

For our REDAXO community map, we use the master branch of the repo [community](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/community), which is part of the organization [FriendsOfREDAXO](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO). Our website is published at https://friendsofredaxo.github.io/community/.

GitHub even allows you to use a custom domain. Awesome!

## 2. The directory containing all map data

The repo not only contains the website but also all map data. Your community members will be able to add and manage their markers by sending pull requests. More on the topic later on.

You‚Äôll need a folder with a leading underscore to keep the map data. The underscore is required for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), the software GitHub uses to generate your website, to identify the folder as a [collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/). In our project, we named the folder `_directory`.

We add another `data` folder to keep `_directory` short and improve visibility of the `README.md` which will contain instructions on how to manage the map later on. The `data` folder will be populated by your community members.

How about the data structure? Have a look at the example file `.data.example.yml`, it‚Äôs a blueprint for a map entry. Any of your community members can add their custom folder to `data` and place a `data.yml` inside containing their marker location and user profile.
‚ÄîThis is what our data folder looks like: [_directory/data](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/community/tree/master/_directory/data).

For now, add your own entry or copy some of ours and start implementing the website:

## 3. Website implementing Leaflet maps

[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) is awesome. It‚Äôs extremely lightweight with no external dependencies. You can choose between various tile providers for your map, like OpenStreetMaps, Mapbox, HERE. We decided to go for the beautiful [CARTO basemaps](https://carto.com/location-data-services/basemaps/) which are free to use up to 75,000 mapviews per month.

To make leaflet grab our map data, we inject it right into the HTML at the bottom of our page. This is dead easy with Jekyll collections, have a look at the [`index.html`](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/community/blob/master/index.html).

Leaflet requires just a little JavaScript to set up the map for us, see [`assets/js/script.js`](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/community/blob/master/assets/js/script.js).

Basically, that‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs some Jekyll configuration (`_config.yml`), templating (`_layouts`) and stuff, but you‚Äôll find out once you dive into the [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).
‚ÄîFor now, just copy our code and start building your own map! üéâ 

## 4. Instructions on how to add and manage markers

This is very important: if you want your community members to participate in the map, you should explain how it works! Best place to do it may be the `README.md` file inside of the `_directory` folder:

![Screenshot: README file in directory folder](/content/images/2017/11/github-directory-readme.png)

We provide 3 options: send a pull request, open an issue or contact us. The first one is preferred as it allows people to add and manager their entry by themselves. But keep in mind not everyone is able to handle pull requests! Some people might not have a GitHub account at all, so you‚Äôd better provide help to add their entries. üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôã

That‚Äôs it, have fun with your map! üöÄ
In case you struggle or have questions, we‚Äôd recommend to set up a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/community/issues). Or even better join our Slack chat! You‚Äôll receive an invitation when providing your email at https://redaxo.org/slack/.
