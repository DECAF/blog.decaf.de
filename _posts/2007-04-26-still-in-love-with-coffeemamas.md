Said this about 2 years ago when they asked my about [my love](http://www.vorsprungdurchwebstandards.de/interviews/fallinginlovewithcss/dirk-schuerjohann/) (to CSS):

> His favorite beans come from Indonesia (he loves Sumatra and Sulawesi)..

Times are a-changin': forget about my indonesian beans. Actually, they are nice.. bold and intensive, earthy aroma, virtually no acidity. Sulawesi ist gorgeous. But I am back on the latin american side of life right now and in love with [coffeemamas](http://www.coffeemamas.de). Located in the heart of Berlin they do hell of a coffee.

Didn’t taste their decaf yet, but I got to sip about eleven coffees all-around, and the House Blend (the latin americans mentioned above) turned out to be my personal [Jamaican Blue Mountain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaican_Blue_Mountain_Coffee). Thank god it’s <del>friday</del> coffee!

_(This is not advertising but enthusiasm. It’s not getting coffee for free but sharing my love.)_
